"""
Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array of integers items of where each integer represents the weight of
an item, implement a function merge_packages that finds the first two items in the items array whose sum of weights equals
the given weight limit limit.

Your function should return a pair [i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j.
If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty array.
